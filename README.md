USER STORY #2
As an inventory management user, I can generate flight itineraries by scheduling a batch of orders. These flights
can be used to determine shipping capacity.
 Use the json file attached to load the given orders.
 The orders listed in the json file are listed in priority order ie. 1..N
Expected output:
order: order-001, flightNumber: 1, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x
...
order: order-099, flightNumber: 1, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x
if an order has not yet been scheduled, output:
order: order-X, flightNumber: not scheduled
